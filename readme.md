# Road Traffic Image Segmentation

This project delves into the realm of segmenting road traffic images using machine learning algorithms. 

## Overview

This project, formed within the context of our project at Hochschule Luzern, is a part of our BSc studies in Mobility, Data Science, and Economics. Spearheaded by Antonio Mastroianni, Finn Sch√ºrmann, and Severin Lindenmann, its core objective is to meticulously delineate elements within road traffic visuals through segmentation methods.

## Approach

The primary approach involves leveraging PyTorch and employing the fcn_resnet101 base model for transfer learning. Customizing it with our dataset enables us to establish weights. Additionally, we've developed a tailored segnet model using the Cityscapes dataset, combining gtFine and leftImg8bit datasets accessible at [Cityscapes Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/).

## Training Details

- **Model Used**: Custom segnet
- **Dataset**: Cityscapes (gtFine, leftImg8bit)
- **Hardware**: Google Colab A100 GPU
- **Training Time**: Approx. 10 hours
- **Image Processing**:
  - Resize: 96x96 pixels
  - Color information retained
- **Classes**: 19 
- **Epoches**: We trained from epoch 1 to 35, with the 27th showing the best results. Further training might yield additional improvements.

The validation in the gif involves using nn.CrossEntropyLoss() on 20 random samples for each epoch.

## Code Repository

The [code repository](https://github.com/swisscenturion/u-net-segmentation-of-streets-and-cars) holds the implementation of our segmentation model. Explore this repository for reference, further development, or to adapt the model for your specific use case.

## Getting Started

To make use of this project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Refer to the README documentation in each folder and review comments in the Jupyter notebooks.
3. Explore, adapt, and utilize the model according to your requirements.

## Demo

There is a demo available [here](https://segmentation.severin.io) (as long as it's running, as it may not be available indefinitely). This demo showcases the functionality of the trained models on sample data.
